        <h2>FPV Drone Components</h2>
        <p>FPV drones consist of several essential components. The frame provides structural integrity, while motors and propellers generate lift and movement. A flight controller serves as the droneâ€™s brain, managing stability and inputs. Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) regulate motor speeds for precise control. The battery powers the entire system, and an FPV camera transmits live video to the pilot. A Video Transmitter (VTX) sends the video feed to goggles or monitors, while a radio transmitter and receiver enable remote control. Antennas improve signal strength for reliable communication.</p>
