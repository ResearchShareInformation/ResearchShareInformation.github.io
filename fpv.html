            <h2>Engineering Design Cycle for FPV Drones</h2>
            <p>The development of FPV drones follows a structured engineering design process, ensuring innovative, reliable, and efficient systems. This cycle is adapted from TeachEngineering.org and tailored to FPV drone development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask:</strong> Define project objectives (e.g., speed for racing, range for inspections), requirements (e.g., lightweight frame, low-latency video), and constraints (e.g., budget, regulations). Ask questions to understand the purpose and scope of the FPV drone project.</li>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Conduct thorough research on existing FPV drone designs, components (e.g., carbon fiber frames, LiPo batteries), and technologies (e.g., 5.8 GHz VTX). Explore user preferences and technological advancements like ExpressLRS for long-range control.</li>
                <li><strong>Imagine:</strong> Brainstorm and conceptualize innovative designs and features (e.g., autonomous flight, modular frames, enhanced OSD). Foster creativity and explore possibilities to meet project objectives, thinking outside the box.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Develop a detailed plan outlining tasks (e.g., component sourcing), timelines (e.g., prototype by week 6), and resources (e.g., CAD tools, 3D printers). Define milestones and allocate responsibilities accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Create:</strong> Bring the design to life by assembling components, fabricating parts (e.g., frames via CNC), and building the FPV drone according to planned specifications. Utilize engineering principles to ensure quality and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Test:</strong> Conduct comprehensive field tests to evaluate performance (e.g., speed, range), functionality (e.g., video feed clarity), and safety (e.g., fail-safes) under various operating conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve:</strong> Analyze test results and user feedback to identify areas for improvement. Iteratively refine the design, components, and operational procedures to enhance performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="system-design">
            <h2>System Design Overview</h2>
            <p>FPV drone system design integrates three main aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specification:</strong> Requirement specification is essential, involving collecting and documenting system needs. Key documents include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product Requirement Document (PRD):</strong> Outlines goals and scope, with input from marketing (market research), customers (feedback), and engineering (technical feasibility).</li>
                    <li><strong>System Requirement Document (SRD):</strong> Focuses on detailed specifications for engineers to guide the design process.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Combines mechanical (e.g., X-frame), hardware (e.g., PCBA with SOC), and software (e.g., RTOS for real-time control) designs. Design documents ensure alignment across teams and customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Engineers focus ideas into a detailed plan, build a prototype, test it, and make improvements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mechanical Design Details</h3>
            <p>Mechanical design focuses on mass-producible products, using CAD tools and 3D printing for precision and iteration:</p>

                <li>Impact of 3D Printing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: A drone with a hyperspectral camera can monitor crops but requires specific equipment for soil analysis or spraying.</p>

            <h3>Hardware Design Details</h3>
            <p>Hardware design connects components to a System-on-Chip (SOC) via a Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Schematics Design:</strong> Detailed electrical connections (power, ground, signals) following guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Rules Checking (DRC):</strong> Ensures compliance with electrical/physical rules, verified via simulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Netlist Generation:</strong> Outlines component connections for main board, daughterboard, and flex PCB.</li>
                <li><strong>PCBA Design Considerations:</strong> Dimension (mm), PCB type (rigid, flex, hybrid), layer stack-up (e.g., 3-6-3 with micro/buried vias).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hardware requirements vary by performance level (low-end, mid-range, high-end) based on power, latency, and durability.</p>

            <h3>Software Design Details</h3>
            <p>Software design partitions functionality and follows a development lifecycle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Systems:</strong> Respond within set times using RTOS, prioritizing interrupts and synchronizing tasks with semaphores.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Phases:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requirements Definition:</strong> Gather and document functional/non-functional requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design:</strong> High-level (architecture) and low-level (algorithms) design using UML.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation & Unit Testing:</strong> Code and test modules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration & System Testing:</strong> Validate the full system (functional, performance, security).</li>
                    <li><strong>Operation & Maintenance:</strong> Deploy, update, and monitor performance.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Agile Approach:</strong> Iterative sprints, collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback (e.g., Scrum framework).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>FPV Drone Technologies</h2>
            <h3>1. Video Transmission & Frequencies</h3>
            <p>Real-time video is critical for FPV. Key technologies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequencies:</strong> 5.8 GHz (high bandwidth, short range), 2.4 GHz (longer range, interference-prone), 1.2 GHz/900 MHz (long-range systems).</li>
                <li><strong>Modulation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Analog (FM):</strong> Simple, low latency, susceptible to interference, lower quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital:</strong> High quality, interference-resistant, higher latency, requires complex hardware.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>ExpressLRS (ELRS):</strong> Open-source, 2.4 GHz protocol with FHSS for long-range, low-latency control.</li>
                <li><strong>Power & Antennas:</strong> VTX power (25-800 mW) affects range; high power risks leakage (unintended RF emission). Antenna gain impacts signal strength and coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Management:</strong> Allocate bands to avoid interference, often coordinated by race organizers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Flight Modes & Control Systems</h3>
            <p>Flight controllers manage stability and maneuvers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acro Mode:</strong> Manual control, no self-leveling—ideal for racing/freestyle.</li>
                <li><strong>Angle Mode:</strong> Auto-leveling, beginner-friendly (stabilized mode).</li>
                <li><strong>Horizon Mode:</strong> Combines Acro flexibility with stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Gyroscopes (rotation), accelerometers (lateral movement) ensure precise control.</li>
            </ul>
